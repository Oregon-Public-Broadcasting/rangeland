### Analysis of BLM Grazing Policies and Rangeland Health

Data for this project comes from the Bureau of Land Management's [Rangeland Administration System](http://www.blm.gov/ras/). The majority of data was downloaded, state by state, from the public-facing side of the database on the agency website. That data includes information on allotments, operators (ranches) and permit schedules.

Data on rangeland health assessments comes from ecologist Peter Lattin and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, who filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the data and received a full copy in 2013. That is the latest year of data the agency has released. OPB/EarthFix did request an updated copy of the data from the Bureau of Land Management. The rangeland health data, which the BLM did not subject to quality assurance or controls, was cleaned and processed by Lattin and PEER, using methodology [established by researchers working for the USGS in 2011](http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1263/).

The geospatial data that make up the maps of grazing allotments shown in this project come from the Bureau of Land Management's [GeoCommunicator](http://www.geocommunicator.gov/GeoComm/) site. Allotments inthe map file were merged with rangeland health assessments and the downloaded data from the Rangeland Administartion System based on unique allotment identification numbers assigned to them by the BLM. The number of allotments, operators and permits is fluid and can change over time. Thus, there is a small number of allotments in the BLM's administrative database that do not have a counterpart on the map, and vice versa. Certain allotments in the map that have no counterpart in the administrative data, such as a large allotment in Wyoming that covered the city of Cheyenne, were omitted from this map because there was no indication they were currently used for grazing and represented current grazing allotments.

The raw data used in this project can be found [here]().

A few notes about the data:

- Because the rangeland health assessment dataset is from 2013, it offers a snapshot in time. Some grazing allotments might have had addtional assessments since then, and their status could have changed. 

- Assessments done on allotments are based on a sampling of acres, in some cases a very small portion of the total amount of acres on the allotment. Thus, and allotment given a passing grade could have acres within it that do not meet federal rangeland health standards. Likewise, an allotment with a failing grade could have acres within it that are actually health rangeland.

- The nubmer of allotments and acres that have been evaluated, and their grades, in the raw data do not match with the Bureau of Land Management's aggregate reports. BLM staff were unsure of the exact reason. However, the agency's aggregate reports are not based on this raw data but instead on reporting by individual states. The BLM says some overcounting could be occuring in its aggregate reports, because states could report multiple assessements done on the same allotments year by year.
